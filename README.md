# **PyXServer** – High-Performance Python Web Server  

**PyXServer** is a lightweight, high-performance web server built with Python, optimized for speed and scalability. It efficiently handles HTTP requests, supports multi-threading, and integrates seamlessly with various web frameworks, making it suitable for both development and production environments.  

## 🚀 Features & Enhancements  

- **High-Speed Request Handling** – Optimized for quick responses to HTTP requests.  
- **Multi-Threading Support** – Handles multiple connections simultaneously for better scalability.  
- **Lightweight** – Minimal resource usage for efficient operation.  
- **Seamless Framework Integration** – Works with popular Python web frameworks.  
- **Real-Time Data Processing** – Handles real-time data updates efficiently.  
- **SSL/TLS Support** – Secure HTTPS connections for web traffic.  
- **Cross-Platform** – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.  

## 📥 Installation  

Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProgrammerKR/PyXServer.git
```
Navigate to the directory:  
```bash
cd PyXServer
```
Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Usage  

### **Running PyXServer**  
To start the server:  
```bash
python pyxserver.py
```
The server will start on **http://localhost:8000** by default.  

### **Custom Configuration**  
You can modify the default configurations by editing the `config.py` file.  

### **Example Usage**  
Here’s how you can integrate it with a basic web app:  
```python
from pyxserver import PyXServer

server = PyXServer()
server.add_route('/', lambda req: 'Hello, World!')
server.start()
```

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Request Handling** – Efficient parsing and processing of HTTP requests.  
2. **Multi-Threading** – Each incoming request is processed in a separate thread, ensuring high concurrency.  
3. **Routing System** – Map URLs to handler functions for flexible request routing.  
4. **Real-Time Processing** – Handle live data such as WebSockets or live data streams.  
5. **Security** – SSL/TLS encryption for secure connections.  

## 🛠️ Future Plans  

- **Advanced Request Queueing** – Implement load balancing for better scalability.  
- **WebSocket Support** – Add support for bi-directional communication.  
- **Docker Integration** – Dockerized deployment for easy scaling.  
- **Database Integration** – Native support for SQL/NoSQL databases.
